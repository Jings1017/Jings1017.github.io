{"posts":[{"title":"Master&#39;s Thesis","text":"CLTP : Contrastive Language-Trajectory Pretraining for Trajectory AnalysisAbstractMultimodal pretraining leverages diverse data types such as text, images, and audio to enhance model in extracting effective representations across different modalities. Previous studies have not explored cross-modal pretraining between text and trajectory data. To address this gap, this research introduces an innovative approach called Contrastive Language-Trajectory Pretraining. It aims to establish a shared feature space between trajectory and text modalities. We propose two alignment techniques to train the proposed framework and thus enhance performance of downstream tasks. Additionally, a novel dataset comprising threedimensional volleyball trajectories and corresponding tactical descriptions is created for volleyball tactical analysis and various volleyball applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Trajectory Pretraining in trajectory-to-text retrieval and text-to-trajectory retrieval tasks. We also empoly the proposed framework in GPS trajectory classification. The proposed method outperforms existing ones and showcases strong generalization capabilities.
